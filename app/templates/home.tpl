<h2>Welcome to Plant</h2>

<h3>If you see this...</h3>

<p>
	...then you've successfully installed <strong>Plant</strong>!.
</p>

<h3>Cool. Where do I go from here?</h3>

<p>
	From here you can dive into the <a href="/siteadmin/">Plant admin</a> and start creating the structure of your site, or
	you can edit this template (<code>/app/templates/home.tpl</code>) and change it to your needs.
</p>

<p>
	Some good first steps are usually:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h4>Change your username and password</h4>
		The installation script will give you a temporary username and password to log in. Once you're logged in, go the <code>users</code> section and click <code>edit</code>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>Change the title of your site</h4>
		To do this, go to the <code>paths</code> section in the Plant admin, hover over the <code>root</code> path and click <code>edit</code>.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ok, thanks!</h3>

<p>
	Wait, hold on! There's something I forgot to tell you.
</p>

<p>
	Oh well. Too late.
