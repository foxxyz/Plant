			<h2>Plant Installation Guide</h2>	
			
			<h3>Welcome To The Greenhouse!</h3>
			
			<p>
				Thanks for trying out Plant! This has been one of my biggest projects to date, and also the one of which I am most proud of.
				For me the main reason to make this framework was to make building a site fun again, regardless of scale. I hope Plant will give you as much joy as it did me.
			</p>
			
			<h3>System Requirements</h3>
			
			<p>
				To make the most flexible system possible, I've embraced some of the more recent technologies available. If your host doesn't provide these, urge them to upgrade!
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Apache 1.3</strong> or higher</li>
				<li><strong>PHP 5.2</strong> or higher</li>
				<li><strong>MySQL 4.0</strong> or higher</li>
				<li>The <strong>mod_rewrite</strong> module installed for Apache</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Starting Out</h3>
					
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Unzip</strong> the package into its own directory</li>
				<li><strong>Modify</strong> <code>config.local.inc.php</code> in the <code>/app/config/</code> directory and fill in the details of your database connection.</li>
				<li><strong>Upload</strong> all the files to your web server!</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Set</strong> write permissions on the following directories so Plant can access data:
					<ul>
						<li><code>/app/controllers/</code></li>
						<li><code>/app/templates/</code></li>
						<li><code>/core/cache/</code></li>
						<li><code>/content/</code></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Run</strong> <code><a href="/install/">/install/</a></code> on your site. Follow the steps, and note the generated password at the end.</li>
				<li><strong>Delete</strong> the <code>/install/</code> directory on your server.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>
				That's it! The installation script will send you to the Site Admin where you'll be able to change your password and start constructing your site.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Random Stuff You Might Need</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The official site for Plant can be found at <a href="http://codedealers.com/projects/plant/">http://codedealers.com/projects/plant/</a>.
				<li>View <a href="changelog.html">the changelog</a> to check what's changed since the last version.</li>
			</ul>
									
			<h3>OK, That's Really It</h3>
			
			<p>
				Enjoy!
			</p>
